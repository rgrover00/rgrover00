**About Me:**

Hello, I'm Ronnie, and I'm excited to welcome you to my GitHub profile! With a dynamic background in IT system administration, web design and development, I've spent the last decade immersed in the world of technology and design. My journey has taken me from the heartland of Oklahoma to the Hudson Valley of New York, and now I proudly call Houston, Texas, my home.

💻 IT System Administration - 
My passion for IT system administration has been at the core of my professional journey. You'll find repositories containing scripts, guides, and tools related to cloud systems, network optimization, and security. I believe in the power of efficient, secure, and scalable IT solutions, and I'm excited to share my knowledge with you.

🖲️ Web Design and Development - 
Web design and development have been my creative outlet and an essential part of my career. From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modern web frameworks, I've dedicated years to crafting web experiences that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. You'll discover code snippets, projects, and resources here that showcase my love for clean, user-friendly design.

🏋️‍♂️ My Interests - Beyond the world of tech, I have a passion for fitness and an at-home gym setup. I believe that maintaining a healthy body is crucial for a sharp mind. You might find repositories related to fitness apps, workout routines, or personal insights on how I balance my tech-heavy life with staying active and fit.
